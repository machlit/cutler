## Introduction

This book, by name, wants to introduce you with <code>cutler</code>, a software made to declaratively manage your macOS preferences and essentials. It can do a number of things. This book will help you navigate all of them, including new ones which are currently in development.

## Basic directions

When you follow along the book, you'll notice both command and code snippets as examples, showing you certain behavior. If the command is prefixed with a `$`, it may mean that you may need to only "follow" the structure
instead of just copy-pasting it. Other times, you can freely do so *if* the criterias specified are met.

If instead the code blocks have their file paths mentioned on top (for most of the time it will be the **config file** of cutler), it describes the structure of certail parts of the file.

## Why cutler

While using macOS, I have come to realize that most solutions like [Nix](https://nixos.org/) are not always easy to maintain either. So, I wanted to create a tool that abstracts away all the complexity into simple, already-known terms for most power users.

And that's how <code>cutler</code> came to be.
