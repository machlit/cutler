## ✨

- A new, optional `template = <bool>` field has been added to the config. As cutler migrates away from hardcoded locks on config to more system-oriented, hardened config locks, this new field will only be used to softlock example configurations provided by the repository.
- Autosync rules have been changed for some commands. This change has been reflected on in the cookbook/documentation.
