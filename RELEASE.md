## ✨

- A new, optional `template = <bool>` field has been added to the config. As cutler migrates away from hardcoded locks on config to more system-oriented, hardened config locks, this new field will only be used to softlock example configurations provided by the repository.

Check the ["Configuration Features"](https://machlit.github.io/cutler/misc/config-features.html) to learn more about config-locking.
